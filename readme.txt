Uses the jQuery plugin ScrollTo by Ariel Flesler to smoothly scroll the user's browser to the top of the page when the user clicks the unobtrusive go-to-top image.

== Description ==

This plugin will display an icon in a corner of the page that, when clicked, will smoothly scroll the user's browser to the top of the page. The plugin comes with options such as which corner the icon should appear in, the distance from the corner, and which icon to use (you can also upload your own). Also, you can turn on the document scroll event to fade the icon in and out when the user scrolls far enough down the page and up again. 

== Installation ==
